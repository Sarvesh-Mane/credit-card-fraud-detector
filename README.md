##Credit Card Fraud Detection Project
This repository contains code for a credit card fraud detection project using machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The dataset (creditcard.rar) included in this repository contains transaction data used for training and testing the fraud detection model. It is compressed in RAR format and includes a CSV file (creditcard.csv) with transaction details.

Note: The RAR file contains a CSV file (creditcard.csv) which serves as the dataset for this project.

Project Structure
creditcard.rar: Compressed file containing creditcard.csv with transaction data.
credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.
